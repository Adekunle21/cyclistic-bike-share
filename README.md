# cyclistic-bike-share
The Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study is a project I worked on as my case study in the Google Professional Data analytics course
Cyclistic is a bike sharing company that has been successful in its industry of bike sharing and has a wide customer base which includes both casual and subscribing members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. The company is looking to answer a major business decision by trying to understand how annual members and casual riders differ and also to replicate the success with the annual members with the casual riders.
The dataset used in this analysis is Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data covering 12months which was downloaded to analyze and identify trends and also give recommendations. I made use of the r programming language in this case study.
